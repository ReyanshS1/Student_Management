Student Management
Student Management System
A full-stack web application for managing student records, built with a .NET Core Web API backend and a React frontend. This system allows administrators to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data, with a responsive and modern user interface.
Features

Student Management: Add, view, update, and delete student records (e.g., name, ID, email, enrollment details).
RESTful API: Backend built with .NET Core Web API, providing secure and scalable endpoints.
Responsive Frontend: React-based interface with modern UI components for seamless user interaction.
Database Integration: Uses [e.g., SQL Server/PostgreSQL] for persistent data storage.
Authentication (Optional): [If implemented, mention JWT-based authentication or similar for secure access].
Error Handling: Robust error handling and validation on both frontend and backend.

Tech Stack

Backend: .NET Core Web API (C#)
Frontend: React (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
Database: [Specify your database, e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or In-Memory]
Styling: [e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or custom CSS]
Other Tools: [e.g., Entity Framework Core, Axios for API calls, etc.]
